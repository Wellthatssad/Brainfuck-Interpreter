#BAD INTERPRETER
## BUT IT WORKS!!
### IT'S MOSTLY A SKID, AND/OR BAD CODE
#### DON'T WHINE TO ME, I WILL CALL YOU DAFT

On an unironic note I would like to thank [Alex Lugo](https://github.com/alugocp) for inspiration and most of my code work, thank you !!! :))), please check his interpreter, for the original code and better interpreter

Just use the makefile.

the executable file takes 2 arguments, the branfuck file and the size of the tape.
I also wrote some optimizaion code(literally only a free frunction for the tape bcuz I like to free my arrays since I am quirky goofy and silly) and the memset bcuz I was running on problems with cells having silly values in them, changed the else ifs to better and superior switch statement and I guess that's all??

please don't judge my programming skills for this project, I do in fact suck but this a "challenge" to try and get me used to c++ after a 10 month hiatus.

Also if there are any grammar problems, IDGAF I wrote this shit at 2 am after a tiring day ok, this is nothign professional I am 16 year old kid.

I hate wirting in markdown so yeah, guess that's it.
